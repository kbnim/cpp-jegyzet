# C++ Lecture Notes
My humble contribution to providing a (hopefully useful) summary of C++ taught at ELTE.

## Summary
The notes cover three areas of the basics of C++:
1. **Basics of C++**: heritage from C, references, memory model and memory management, types, scope and lifetime.
2. **Object-oriented programming**: `struct`s vs. `class`es, visibility, inheritance, static fields and methods, operators, copy constructor vs. assignment operator, casting, `friend` keyword
3. **Templates and STL**: template functions, template classes, dependent scopes, iterators, fundamental algorithms and data structures 

The document is written in $\LaTeX$.

Many thanks to _Tibor Brunner_, my instructor, for taking the time to proofread my notes.

## Remarks
- As of now, the lecture notes have been proofread, however, the recommended corrections are yet to be implemented.
- Please note that the lecture notes are written in Hungarian. I do not intend to translation it to English. Having said that,
  - the examples code snippets use English names for variables, functions, classes, etc.
  - for each keyword and definition, I gave the English translation; that way, making it easier to navigate in the document.
